            <div className="collapse-content">
              <p>Laughter is a powerful tool that brings numerous benefits to our lives. It serves as a natural stress reliever, releasing endorphins that enhance our mood and promote a sense of well-being. Physically, laughter improves heart health by increasing blood flow and relaxing blood vessels. It can also strengthen the immune system, helping us fight off illness more effectively. Beyond health, laughter fosters connections with others, creating bonds and enhancing relationships. It acts as a social glue, allowing us to share joy and lightness in everyday moments. Furthermore, laughter can inspire creativity, enabling us to think outside the box and approach challenges with a fresh perspective. In tough times, a good laugh can provide relief and help us cope with difficult situations. Ultimately, embracing laughter in our lives enriches our experiences and enhances our overall happiness.</p>

            <h2>When has your neighbour laughed the last time?</h2>
          </div>
    <div className="collapse-content">
      <p>People laugh at varying frequencies, depending on factors like age, social environment, and individual personality. On average:

- **Children**: Young children laugh significantly more than adults, often laughing about 300 times a day. This high frequency is linked to their playful nature and their tendency to find joy in simple things.

- **Adults**: Adults typically laugh around 15 to 100 times a day. This range can fluctuate based on mood, social interactions, and the environment. People in social settings or with a good sense of humor may laugh more frequently.

- **Seniors**: Older adults may laugh less frequently, often due to lifestyle changes, health issues, or fewer social interactions. However, laughter remains important for their well-being.

### Factors Influencing Laughter Frequency
1. **Social Interactions**: Engaging in conversations, watching comedies, or spending time with friends can increase laughter.
2. **Environment**: A positive or humorous environment encourages more laughter.
3. **Cultural Differences**: Different cultures have varying attitudes toward humor and laughter, affecting how often people laugh.
4. **Personality Traits**: Individuals with a more playful or outgoing personality tend to laugh more than those who are more reserved.

Overall, while there is a general range for laughter frequency, individual experiences can vary widely.</p>
